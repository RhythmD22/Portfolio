        <p style="font-size: 1.15rem;">A Twine game blending fantasy and sci-fi, following a knight flung into a
          corporate-dystopian future where his moral compass is tested across different timelines. Built with
          branching paths, dynamic outcomes, and a climactic minigame, the story adapts to player-defined values
          like duty, honor, and adaptability.</p>

        "The general workflow from there was that we would tag team writing each of the 5 acts
        of the story while Rhythm would implement each scene in Twine. During the process,
        though, we floated the idea of more mechanical challenges at certain points. I saw them
        as kind of a stretch goal for the project after we got everything else done, so I wrote
        around the assumption that they would not be in the game. Despite that however,
        Rhythm went ahead and managed to program both the attack minigame (click on the
        enemy icons as they appear) and escape minigames (use the arrow keys to avoid the
        enemies) in Twine which impressed me to no end. I took acts 1, 3, and 5, and Rhythm
        took 2 and 4. This seems like a fairly balanced spread, but since act 5 is where all the
        unique endings took place it ended up being the most dense act to write for by far."
